Who wants to be a millionaire.

## Getting Started

Before the start, you need to setup (or change) _**config.json**_ file, that is in src folder. There you can edit and add questions, its answers and other things.
The structure for config you can see in types (src/types/config.ts).

Firstly, you need to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you want to build your project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

After that you can preview your project by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

If you want to lint your project, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The project also is deployed to Vercel, so you can see it [here](https://who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-lovat.vercel.app/).
